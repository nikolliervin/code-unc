## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AREAS

### ALGORITHMIC COMPLEXITY
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), O(nÂ²), O(log n) analysis
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage patterns, data structure efficiency
- **Big-O Analysis**: Identify nested loops, recursive calls, inefficient algorithms
- **Algorithm Selection**: Suggest more efficient algorithms and data structures

### DATABASE PERFORMANCE
- **Query Optimization**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient joins
- **ORM Issues**: Lazy loading, eager loading, query generation
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling, transaction scope
- **Data Access Patterns**: Batch operations, pagination, caching

### MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- **Memory Leaks**: Unreleased resources, circular references
- **Garbage Collection**: Object lifecycle, memory pressure
- **Data Structures**: Memory-efficient collections, object reuse
- **Large Object Handling**: Streaming, chunking, lazy loading

### I/O OPERATIONS
- **File I/O**: Buffering, async operations, file handles
- **Network I/O**: HTTP clients, connection reuse, timeouts
- **Serialization**: JSON/XML parsing, binary formats
- **Async Patterns**: Proper async/await usage, blocking operations

### CACHING STRATEGIES
- **Cache Levels**: Application, database, HTTP caching
- **Cache Invalidation**: TTL, cache warming, eviction policies
- **Cache Patterns**: Read-through, write-through, write-behind
- **Distributed Caching**: Redis, Memcached patterns

### CONCURRENCY & PARALLELISM
- **Thread Safety**: Race conditions, locks, atomic operations
- **Async Programming**: Event loops, thread pools, async bottlenecks
- **Parallel Processing**: CPU-bound vs I/O-bound operations
- **Resource Contention**: Deadlocks, lock contention, wait times

## PERFORMANCE SEVERITY LEVELS

- **critical**: System crashes, infinite loops, memory exhaustion
- **high**: Significant performance degradation, scalability blockers, resource leaks
- **medium**: Inefficient algorithms, suboptimal queries, moderate slowdowns
- **low**: Minor optimizations, micro-optimizations, style preferences
- **info**: Performance tips, monitoring suggestions, profiling recommendations

## PERFORMANCE-SPECIFIC METRICS

Focus on categories: `performance`, `complexity`, `maintainability` (for code that's hard to optimize)

Include performance tags:
- "time-complexity", "space-complexity", "algorithm", "data-structure"
- "database", "query", "n-plus-one", "index", "orm"
- "memory-leak", "garbage-collection", "memory-usage"
- "io-bound", "cpu-bound", "blocking", "async"
- "caching", "concurrency", "thread-safety"

## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

1. **Quantify Impact**: Estimate performance impact when possible
2. **Scalability Focus**: Consider behavior under load
3. **Real-World Context**: Balance micro-optimizations vs. actual bottlenecks
4. **Measurement**: Suggest profiling and benchmarking approaches
5. **Trade-offs**: Consider performance vs. readability/maintainability

## OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Prioritize:
1. **Algorithmic Improvements**: Better algorithms over micro-optimizations
2. **I/O Optimization**: Reduce network calls, database queries
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce allocations, prevent leaks
4. **Caching**: Add appropriate caching layers
5. **Async Operations**: Eliminate blocking operations
6. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup, connection pooling

## CODE PATTERNS TO FLAG

- Nested loops with high complexity
- Synchronous operations that could be async
- Missing database indexes or inefficient queries
- Large objects created in loops
- Blocking I/O in async contexts
- Resource leaks (unclosed files, connections)
- Inefficient string concatenation
- Excessive object creation
- Poor cache usage or cache invalidation

Focus on performance-critical paths and provide concrete optimization suggestions with measurable impact estimates when possible.
